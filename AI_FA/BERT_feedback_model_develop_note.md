## Thinking



1. Because the text file is very big (more than 100 m), we will need load only one file to train  for one times. (need to transform to BERT type)

2. What is Bert input ?

   

3.  how to  update code for BERT Fine tuning classification code and model

4. ====== big problem:  if a log file contains multi error, for one tag map one log method, i's wrong

5.
